If you can’t show your best friend your worst side or your ugly moments, and have them still love you through it, then are they really your best friend? Don’t stick with someone that you always have to have a mask around. Be open with your friends, be willing to let them in, even in your lowest, toughest, saddest, baddest, most difficult times. Then you can truly know that God has given you friends that you can hold on to, and trust them with your everything.
