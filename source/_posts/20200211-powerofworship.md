There are a lot of people who don’t realize how powerful a group of believers worshipping together can be. I’ve seen several churches where worshipping is just another item in the service program, instead of believers gathering to praise our Father.

Today for our youth band, I was running the sound, and we were singing Yes I Am, Bigger than I thought, and Ever Almighty, and by the time we reached the last song, the youth group was singing their hearts our together, so I turned off the singer’s microphones and turned down all the instruments, and all you could hear was this room full of people all worshipping God, United as one. That was one of the most powerful things I’ve ever experienced, and that is one of the few reasons why I decided to commit myself to ministry through worship.
